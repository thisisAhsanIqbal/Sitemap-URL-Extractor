# Sitemap URL Extractor

An advanced asynchronous Python tool that **fetches and extracts all URLs** (and optional last-modified dates) from multiple sitemap XML files.  
Results are saved in a structured Excel file with high-speed processing and colorful progress tracking.

Built with `aiohttp`, `asyncio`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`, this tool processes **multiple sitemaps** concurrently.
